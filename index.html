            <p><strong><em><a href="#">Ferugliotherium</a></em></strong> was a mammal of the Late Cretaceous, around 70 million years ago. The genus was first described in 1986 but misidentified as a member of Multituberculata, an extinct group of rodent-like mammals, on the basis of a single tooth, a low-crowned molar. It is thought to have had a small body mass, about 70 g &lpar;2.5 oz&rpar;, and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of present-day southern Argentina, as part of a mammal fauna that included the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids. The upper and lower incisors were long and rodent-like, with enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long. Although Ferugliotherium had much lower-crowned teeth than the sudamericids, they shared the same backward jaw movement during chewing and essentially similar patterns in their incisors and on the chewing surface of their molar-like teeth, with small enamel prisms. &lpar;<strong><a href="#">Full article</a>...</strong>&rpar;</p>
